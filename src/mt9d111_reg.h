/**
 * Bit 15 - Synchronize Changes: By default, update of many registers are synchronized to frame start. Setting this bit inhibits
 * this update; register changes remain pending until this bit is returned to "0". When this bit is returned to “0,” all pending
 * register updates are made on the next frame start.
 *
 * Bit 10 - Toggle S_ADDR: By default, the sensor serial bus responds to addresses 0xBA and 0xBB. When this bit is set, the sensor
 * serial bus responds to addresses 0x90 and 0x91. WRITEs to this bit are ignored when STANDBY is asserted. See "Slave Address"
 * on page 181.
 *
 * Bit 9 - Restart Bad Frames: When set, a restart is forced to take place whenever a bad frame is detected. This can shorten the
 * delay when waiting for a good frame because the delay, when masking out a bad frame, is the integration time rather than the
 * full frame time.
 *
 * Bit 8 - Show Bad Frames: 1 - Output all frames (including bad frames).
 *                          0 - Only output good frames (default). A bad frame is defined as the first frame following a change to:
 *                          window size or position, horizontal blanking, pixel clock speed, zoom, row or column skip, binning,
 *                          mirroring, or use of border.
 *
 * Bits 7:6 - Inhibit Standby/Drive Pins: 00 or 01 - setting STANDBY high puts sensor into standby state with high-impedance outputs.
 *                                        10 - setting STANDBY high only puts the outputs in High-Z.
 *                                        11 - causes STANDBY to be ignored.
 *
 * Bit 5 - Reset SOC: When this bit is set to 1, SOC is put in reset state. It exits this state when the bit is set back to 0. Any
 * attempt to access SOC registers (IFP page 1 and 2) in the reset state results in a sensor hang-up. The sensor cannot recover
 * from it without a hard reset or power cycle.
 *
 * Bit 4 - Output Disable: Setting this bit to 1 puts the pin interface in a High-Z. See "Output Enable Control" on page 153.
 * If the D OUT *, PIXCLK, Frame_Valid, or Line_Valid is floating during STANDBY, this bit should be set to “0” to turn off the
 * input buffer, reducing standby current (see technical note TN0934 "Standby Sequence"). This bit must work together with bit 6
 * to take effect.
 *
 * Bit 3 - Reserved: Keep at default value.
 *
 * Bit 2 - Standby: Setting this bit to 1 places the sensor in a low-power state. Any attempt to access registers R[0xF7:0xFD]:0
 * in this state results in a sensor hang-up. The sensor cannot recover from it without a hard reset or power cycle.
 *
 * Bit 1 - Restart: Setting this bit causes the sensor to truncate the current frame and start resetting the first row.
 * The delay before the first valid frame is read out is equal to the integration time. This bit is write - 1 but always
 * reads back as 0.
 *
 * Bit 0 - Reset: Setting this bit puts the sensor in reset; the frame being generated is truncated and the pin interface goes
 * to an idle state. All internal registers (except for this bit) go to the default power-up state. Clearing this bit resumes
 * normal operation.

/**
 * Bit 15 - Binning-Context B: When read mode context B is selected (R0xF2:0[3] = 1):
 *                             0 - Normal operation.
 *                             1 - Binning enabled. See "Binning" on page 127 and See “Frame Rate Control” on page 128 for
 *                             a full description.
 * 
 * Bit 13 - Zoom Enable: 0 - Normal operation.
 *                       1 - Zoom is enabled, with zoom factor [zoom] defined in bits 12:11.
 *                       In zoom mode, the pixel data rate is slowed by a factor of [zoom]. This is achieved by outputting
 * [zoom - 1] blank rows between each output row. Setting this mode allowsthe user to fill a window that is [zoom] times larger with
 * interpolated data. The pixel clock speed is not affected by this operation, and the output data for each pixel is valid for
 * [zoom] pixel clocks. Every row is followed by [zoom - 1] blank rows (with their own LINE_VALID, but all data bits = 0) of equal time.
 * The combination of this register and an appropriate change to the window sizing registers allows the user to zoom to a region
 * of interest without affecting the frame rate.
 *
 * Bits 12:11 - Zoom: When zoom is enabled by bit 13, this field determines the zoom amount:
 *                    00 - Zoom 2x
 *                    01 - Zoom 4x
 *                    10 - Zoom 8x
 *                    11 - Zoom 16x
 *

 *                               0 - Use both ADCs to achieve maximum speed.
 *                               1 - Use 1 ADC to reduce power. Maximum readout frequency is now half the master clock frequency, and the
 *                               pixel clock is automatically adjusted as described for the pixel clock speed register.
 *
 * Bit 9 - Show Border: This bit indicates whether to show the border enabled by bit 8.
 *                      0 - Border is enabled but not shown; vertical blanking is increased by 8 rows and horizontal blanking is
 *                      increased by 8 pixels.
 *                      1 - border is enabled and shown; FRAME_VALID time is extended by 8 rows and LINE_VALID is extended by 8 pixels.
 *                      See “Pixel Border” on page 124.
 *
 * Bit 8 - Over Sized: 0 - Normal UXGA size.
 *                     1 - Adds a 4-pixel border around the active image array independent of readout mode (skip, zoom, mirror, etc.).
 *                     Setting this bit adds 8 to the number of rows and columns in the frame.
 *
 * Bit 7 - Column Skip Enable-Context B: When read mode context B is selected (R0xF2:0[3] = 1):
 *                                       1 - Enable column skip.
 *                                       0 - Normal readout.
 *

 *                                    1 - Enable row skip.
 *                                    0 - Normal readout.
 * 
 * Bits 3:2 - Row Skip-Context B: When read mode context B is selected (R0xF2:0[3] = 1) and Row skip is enabled (bit 4 = 1):
 *                                00 - Row Skip 2x
 *                                01 - Row Skip 4x

 *                                See "Column and Row Skip" on page 125 for more information.
 * 
 * Bit 1 - Mirror Columns: Read out columns from right to left (mirrored). When set, column readout starts from column (column
 * start + column size) and continues down to (column start + 1). When clear, readout starts at column start and continues to (column
 * start + column size - 1). This ensures that the starting color is maintained.
 *
 * Bit 0 - Mirror Rows: Read out rows from bottom to top (upside down). When set, row readout starts from row (row start + row size) and
 * continues down to (row start + 1). When clear, readout starts at row start and continues to (row start + row size -1).
 * This ensures that the starting color is maintained.

 *
 * Bit 4 - Step Size Forced To 1: When set, the step size is forced to 1 for the rapid sweep algorithm. Default operation (0) is to

/**
 * Bit 0 - Enable spoof frame: When this bit is set, the data captured in the output FIFO is sent out as a spoofed frame,
 * formatted according to information stored in the various spoof registers. This output mode can be used to output
 * both JPEG-compressed and uncompressed image data. JPEG data may be padded if dummy data is needed. During LINE_VALID
 * assertion period, the output clock is only clocked when there is valid JPEG data or padded dummy data to be transmitted.
 * This may result in a non-uniform clock period. When LINE_VALID is de-asserted, the output clock is enabled according
 * to SPOOF_LV_LEAD and SPOOF_LV_TRAIL setting. JPEG SOI/EOI markers cannot be inserted into spoof frames.
 *
 * Bit 1 - Enable output pixel clock between frames: When set, this bit enables the pixel clock to run whether FRAME_VALID
 * is LOW or HIGH. Clearing the bit disables the clock during the periods when FRAME_VALID is de-asserted except for
 * SOI/EOI markers transmission if they are outside the FV assertion period. The gating off of this output pixel clock
 * saves power.
 *
 * Bit 2 - Enable pixel clock during invalid data: When this bit is set, the pixel clock runs continuously while FRAME_VALID
 * is asserted but LINE_VALID is de-asserted. When cleared, it causes the pixel clock to be active only when valid JPEG
 * data are output. Disabling pixel clock during LINE_VALID de-assertion is not support in spoof frame.
 *
 * Bit 3 - Enable SOI/EOI insertion: When set, this bit causes SOI and EOI markers to be output at the beginning and end
 * of every JPEG-encoded frame. When the bit is cleared, only JPEG data bytes are output.
 *
 * Bit 4 - Insert SOI and EOI when FRAME_VALID is HIGH: When it is “1,” SOI and EOI are inside FV assertion period.
 * When it is”0,” SOI, and EOI are outside FRAME_VALID assertion period. This bit is relevant only when SOI/EOI insertion
 * is enabled.
 *
 * Bit 5 - Ignore spoof frame height: This bit is used in conjunction with bit 0 that enables spoof framing. When this
 * bit is set, the JPEG unit output section ignores the spoof frame height register. The spoof frame ends when either
 * JPEG bytes or uncompressed image data are exhausted. Both kinds of data are always padded with dummy data to the
 * programmed spoof frame width.
 *
 * Bit 6 - Enable variable pixel clock rate: Setting this bit enables the adaptive pixel clock frequency feature. The
 * pixel clock is switched from PCLK1 to PCLK2 to PCLK3, depending on the output FIFO fullness. When fullness reaches
 * 50%, the pixel clock is switched from PCLK1 to PCLK2. When the fullness reaches 75%, the clock is switched to PCLK3.
 * As the FIFO fullness drops below 50%, PIXCLK switches from PCLK3 to PCLK2; as it drops below 25%, it switches
 * back to PCLK1. At the start of a frame, it always starts with PCLK1.
 *
 * Bit 7 - Enable byte swap: Toggling this bit swaps the even and odd bytes in JPEG data stream. Byte swapping supported
 * only when enable spoof frame is set.
 *
 * Bit 8 - Duplicate FRAME_VALID on LINE_VALID: When this bit is set, the FRAME_VALID waveform is output on LINE_VALID
 * output also; therefore, the two are identical.
 *
 * Bit 9 - Enable status insertion: When this bit is set, the JPEG module appends the status byte to the end of the JPEG
 * byte stream. This register should only be set when transferring in continuous mode. The status byte inserted at the
 * end of the JPEG byte stream is Reg2 bit [7:0].
 *
 * Bit 10 - Enable spoof ITU-R BT.601 codes: This bit is relevant matters when uncompressed frames are output in the
 * spoof mode. When set, the bit causes the ITU-R BT.601 markers SOF, EOF, SOL, EOL to be inserted into every frame.
 * Codes are:
 * Start of Frame:  FF0000AB
 * End of Frame:    FF0000B6
 * Start of Line:   FF000080
 * End of Line:     FF00009D
 *
 * Bit 11 - Freeze_update; Default = 0. When set, it disables the transfer of values from registers 0x0A, 0x0D (except
 * freeze_update), 0x0E, 0x0F, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12 into their corresponding shadow registers. When cleared, the shadow
 * registers are updated with values from their corresponding configuration registers at the end of vertical blanking
 * of the input image. The shadow registers allow the microcontroller to change configuration registers values during
 * the active frame time without corrupting the current frame transfer.
