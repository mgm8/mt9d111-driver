         *     - 1) The first method is to assert STANDBY, which places the chip into hard standby. Turning
         *          off the input clock (EXTCLK) reduces the standby power consumption to the maximum
         *          specification of 100 uA at 55 oC. There is no serial interface access for hard standby.
         *     - 2) The second method is activated through the serial interface by setting R0x0D:0[2] = 1 known
         *          as the soft standby. As long as the input clock remains on, the chip will allow access
         *          through the serial interface in soft standby.
         *     .
         *
         * Standby should only be activated from the preview mode (context A), and not the capture mode
         * (context B). In addition, the PLL state (off/bypassed/activated) is recorded at the time of firmware
         * standby (seq.cmd = 3) and restored once the camera is out of firmware standby. In both hard and soft
         * standby scenarios, internal clocks are turned off and the analog circuitry is put into a low power
         * state. Exit from standby must go through the same interface as entry to standby. If the input clock
         * is turned off, the clock must be restarted before leaving standby.
         *
         * To Enter Standby
         *     - 1) To prepare for standby:
         *              - a) Issue the STANDBY command to the firmware by setting seq.cmd = 3
         *              - b) Poll seq.state until the current state is in standby (seq.state = 9)
         *              - c) Bypass the PLL if used by setting R0x65:0[15] = 1
         *              .
         *     - 2) To prevent additional leakage current during standby:
         *              - a) Set R0x0A:1[7] = 1 to prevent elevated standby current. It will control the
         *                   bidirectional pads D OUT , LINE_VALID, FRAME_VALID, PIXCLK.
         *              - b) If the outputs are allowed to be left in an unknown state while in standby, the
         *                   current can increase. Therefore, either have the receiver hold the camera outputs
         *                   HIGH or LOW, or allow the camera to drive its outputs to a known state by setting
         *                   R0x0D:0[6] = 1. R0x0D:0[4] needs to remain at the default value of "0". In this case,
         *                   some pads will be HIGH while some will be LOW. For dual camera systems, at least
         *                   one camera has to be driving the bus at any time so that the outputs will not be
         *                   left floating.
         *              - c) Configure internal reserved I/O as outputs and drive LOW by the setting the respective
         *                   bit to "0" in the reserved I/O variables 0x1078, 0x1079, 0x1070, and 0x1071 (accessed
         *                   through R0xC6:1 and R0xC8:1). The following settings should be used:
         *                       - i)    R0xC6:1 = 0x9078
         *                       - ii)   R0xC8:1 = 0x0000
         *                       - iii)  R0xC6:1 = 0x9079
         *                       - iv)   R0xC8:1 = 0x0000
         *                       - v)    R0xC6:1 = 0x9070
         *                       - vi)   R0xC8:1 = 0x0000
         *                       - vii)  R0xC6:1 = 0x9071

         *              .
         *     - 3) To put the camera in standby: Assert STANDBY = 1. Optionally, stop the EXTCLK clock to minimize
         *          the standby current specified in the MT9D131 data sheet. For soft standby, program standby

         *                   standby was used.

         *              - a) Go to preview.
         *              - b) Issue a GO_PREVIEW command to the firmware by setting seq.cmd = 1.
         *              - c) Poll seq.state until the current state is preview (seq.state = 3).

         *     - 3) The following timing requirements should be met to turn off EXTCLK during hard standby:
         *              - a) After the asserting standby, wait 10 clock cycles before stopping the clock.
         *              - b) Restart the clock 24 clock cycles before de-asserting standby.
